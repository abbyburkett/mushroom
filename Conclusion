Conclusion of the project:
Overall, both the base model and the model with K-best input features performed exceptionally well on the classification task, achieving perfect scores across all performance metrics. 
This suggests that the selected features in the K-best model were highly informative and sufficient for accurate classification, without sacrificing model performance. 
We could use all features or just one feature to accurately predict the edibility of the mushrooms. We use one feature because it's the simpler model. 
Additionally, the base model, which likely included all available features, did not outperform the model with K-best features, indicating that feature selection effectively 
identified the most relevant features for classification.
